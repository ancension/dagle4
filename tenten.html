    Tenten (テンテン, Tenten) is a kunoichi from Konohagakure and a member of Team Guy. While initially wanting to be like the legendary Sannin Tsunade, she realised that she did not have the necessary chakra control to be a medical-nin. However, she did not give up on being a powerful kunoichi, putting her all into perfecting her weaponry and fūinjutsu skills.

    Tenten is depicted as naturally inquisitive and observant, with a personal dream to become a legendary kunoichi like Tsunade. This has led to her to become strongly opinionated about women, defending that girls can be just as skilled as boys in taijutsu when Neji thought otherwise. Tenten exhibits a distaste for weakness or being overly dependent on other people. Though she can be quite fierce at times,[8] Tenten is kind and caring toward others, comforting her friends when they are going through a hard time.[9]

Being around her overly enthusiastic teammates, particularly Might Guy and Rock Lee, Tenten is often left exasperated at their antics and wishes they would behave more maturely; her Infinite Tsukuyomi dream actually depicts this. She is more easy-going and dislikes having to travel for whole days[10] or continue training when she is already tired, for which reason she enjoys her days-off from missions. However, she cares greatly about her team, helping to go save Lee during the Chūnin Exams when he didn't report back at their base. She also held great respect for her other teammate Neji Hyūga and often helped him train.

Naturally Tenten, who was a ninja-tool user, loves ninja weapons to the point that she collects every ninja tool from all over the world as a hobby. Moreover, her hobby developed so much that she even opened a full-fledged ninja tool shop.[11] She also appears to have a fascination with the supernatural, believing in ghosts and the likes.[12]

Tenten is a highly skilled and capable kunoichi; her skills being held in high regard by her team. By Part II, she became a chūnin,[3] capable of pressuring the likes of Kisame Hoshigaki with the aid of her teammates.[13] As an adult, Tenten is remarked as a kunoichi who excelled at space–time ninjutsu,[11] which she can use to summon puppets equipped with a kunai-firing gun.
