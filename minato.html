      He is the father of Naruto Uzumaki When Minato is at the Academy, his classmate and future wife, Uzumaki Kushina thinks that Minato's attitude is not fixed, ungallant and unreliable. Kushina considers Minato to be the same as others who demean and laugh at him. When Kushina introduces herself in front of the class, Kushina says that she has dreams of becoming the first female Hokage. Minato said that he also dreamed of his existence being recognized by konoha villagers by becoming a Hokage, but Kushina ignored him. Years later, when Kushina is kidnapped by Kumogakure ninja, Minato is the only one to save her based on the trail Kushina left in the form of strands of her red hair along the way. After saving her, Minato said that he always admired Kushina's red hair which was considered strange by many, so Minato was the first to praise the hair. That way, Kushina no longer thinks as she had always thought of Minato, and also felt that Minato helped her from solitude. From then on Kushina fell in love with Minato.

According to those who knew him personally, Minato was a very talented prodigy. He is a rare ninja genius. He graduated from the Academy at the age of ten, and was added to Genin's team under Jiraiya's supervision. Jiraiya was interested in training Minato and accepting him as a student, a move that Jiraiya taught among others to teach him animal calling. He even believes Minato may be a child in the frog elder's prophecy who will one day save the world. However, Minato entrusted the role to his son, Naruto.

At one time during his reign as Hokage, he read Jiraiya's first novel. He liked the determination of the main character he trusted like Jiraiya. Since Kushina conceived their son, Minato tells Jiraiya that they plan to name their son "Naruto" in hopes that he will become like the main character in the novel. Jiraiya reminded them that it would make him like Grandpa Naruto, but they insisted that this was something good.

Since Kushina is the Jinchuuriki of the Kyuubi no Youko, a special deal must be made for Naruto's birth. The Kyuubi seal is awake inside Kushina's body, but the seal is weak during labor. Kushina will be secretly sent to a remote area outside Konoha. Anbu will guard the area and Minato will keep the seal while Kushina enters labor. Having not had time to re-strengthen the seals that had been weakened after Naruto was born, they were found by Tobi who had killed Anbu who was placed outdoors. Tobi kills Biwako Sarutobi and Taji then takes Naruto hostage and threatens to do the same to him. Minato was able to take Naruto back, but this gave Tobi a chance to escape with Kushina. Minato teleports to safety to put Naruto down and then teleports back to Kushina. He arrives in time to see the Kyuubi that has been released from Kushina's body, then Tobi tries to kill Kushina through the Kyuubi that has been controlled by the Sharingan. Fortunately, Minato managed to save him with Hiraishin's moves, and teleported back to Naruto's place. Minato reunited his mother and son and then went on to help defend Konoha from the Kyuubi.

Minato arrives at the beginning of the Kyuubi attack. After protecting the village from Bijuudama, Minato tries to meet the Third Hokage to inform him of what has happened, but is stopped by Tobi. Minato manages to escape from Jikukan Ido Tobi's move, but is followed by Tobi. When the two begin to fight, Minato struggles to attack Tobi. Tobi's translucent body was touched every time he was being attacked. When they matched the speed, Minato threw kunai at Tobi's head which then penetrated again, then Minato took out Rasengan accompanied by teleport using a level 2 Hiraishin move to the kunai that was hovering over Tobi's body so that it did not have time to attack Tobi, managed to attack with Rasengan moves and mark Tobi's body with a seal. With the seal, Minato teleports to Tobi's body and places a contract seal on Tobi's body to remove control of the Kyuubi, forcing Tobi to retreat.

When Minato returned to the village he found many ruins. He called Gamabunta to overwrite and pressed the Kyuubi's body long enough to teleport away from the village. Naruto and Kushina were joined by Minato and kyuubi. Kushina who endured pain and was dying after giving birth and also the Kyuubi was released, voluntarily sealed the Kyuubi back into her body so that it would die with him, but Minato disagreed and instead decided he would use Shiki Fuujin to seal half of the Kyuubi chakra into his body and then seal the rest into Naruto's body. Kushina objected because Minato would die and leave Naruto as an orphan. Minato insists it's best because if it shuts down the Kyuubi, it creates an imbalance of Bijuu. After all, Minato wanted the role of a mother to also exist in Naruto's life, by infusing a bit of Kushina's chakra into the Kyuubi seal, Kushina was able to meet as Naruto tried to control the Kyuubi chakra. In addition, Minato is convinced that Naruto is the "Son in prophecy" that Jiraiya once told and will need kyuubi power to one day defeat Tobi. After using Shiki Fuujin to seal the Yin Kyuubi chakra, the Kyuubi realized their intentions and tried to kill Naruto. Then Minato and Kushina use their bodies to protect him.

Minato called Gerotora and gave him the key of the Kyuubi seal to be pinned to Naruto's stomach, and told him to send it to Jiraiya. After Kushina told Naruto how much they loved him, and finished all his sayings and then Minato sealed the Kyuubi and a little bit of their chakra into Naruto's body, so they would be able to see him again when Naruto was pushed by the Kyuubi, albeit only temporarily.
