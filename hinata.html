   Hinata Hyuga (日向 ヒナタ, Hyūga Hinata) is a fictional character in the anime and manga Naruto, created by Masashi Kishimoto. Hinata is a kunoichi and the former heiress of the Hyūga clan from the fictional village of Konohagakure. She is also a member of Team 8, which consists of herself, Kiba Inuzuka with his ninja dog — Akamaru, Shino Aburame, and team leader Kurenai Yuhi. At the start of the series, Hinata has strong admiration toward the main protagonist — Naruto Uzumaki, which eventually turns into love as the story progresses. Hinata has appeared several times in the series' feature films, most notably The Last: Naruto the Movie (2014), which revolves around her relationship with Naruto. She has also been present in other media related to the franchise, including video games, original video animations, and the manga and anime sequel Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (2016), in which she has become the mother of Boruto Uzumaki and Himawari Uzumaki, and is now named Hinata Uzumaki (うずまき ヒナタ, Uzumaki Hinata).[1]

Kishimoto had originally created Hinata as a person who would not fight across the story, but in the end he chose to portray her as a kunoichi. In the making of the series, Kishimoto had decided Hinata would marry Naruto; however, the plot regarding their romance was conceived by screenwriter Maruo Kyozuka. Hinata's design has been modified by Kishimoto throughout the franchise's story in order to fit the character's growth. She is voiced by Nana Mizuki in the original animated series and Stephanie Sheh in the English adaptations. Critical reception to the character has been mostly positive due to her actions in the series and her bigger role in The Last — her interactions with Naruto and her engagement in a conflict with the film's villain have been praised. Hinata has also been popular with the Naruto reader base, placing high in some polls. Merchandise based on Hinata have been released, including action figures, key chains and figurines.

In Naruto
Hinata, the eldest of Hiashi Hyuga's two children, is raised as the heiress to Hyuga clan's main household due to Hiashi being the elder between him and his twin brother, Hizashi, and thereby making Hiashi head of the clan while Hizashi is demoted to the Branch House whose only purpose is to serve the upper branch. Hinata is nearly kidnapped at a young age, though saved by her father; this serves as the catalyst of the Hyuga Affair, which ends with Hizashi willingly taking the place of Hiashi to compensate for the death of the head ninja who tried to kidnap Hinata so that a breach in the treaty between the Hyuga clan's village of Konohagakure and Kumogakure is prevented.[23] Growing up, Hinata is trained by Hiashi, but he begins to have doubts about her ability to lead the clan after seeing her struggles during their sessions. As a result, he apparently disowns her, having her younger sister, Hanabi Hyuga, as the heiress.[24] Hinata also meets Naruto Uzumaki during her youth, developing an interest in him after he defends her while she is being bullied because of her eyes.[25] That event and Naruto's refusal to give up against adversity inspire Hinata to become a stronger person. However, Hinata's admiration for Naruto gradually turns into romantic feelings.

Hinata is introduced in Part I of the Naruto manga during the Chunin Exams, a series of tests that are meant to upgrade her status as a rookie, along with her teammates — Kiba Inuzuka and Shino Aburame.[26] She reaches the third examination, where she is forced to fight her cousin, Neji Hyuga.[24] Despite her fears, Naruto encourages her to battle him.[27] She is nearly killed in combat, and Naruto decides to avenge her.[28] At the end of Part I, after Naruto leaves to be trained by Jiraiya, Hinata vows to become a stronger person.[29] In Part II, two-and-a-half years after the events of Part I, Hinata has been promoted to Chunin and reunites with Naruto, fainting at seeing him for the first time in years.[30] Hinata and her team aid Team Kakashi on a collaborative mission to find both rogue ninja Sasuke Uchiha and his brother, Itachi Uchiha, though the mission is ultimately a failure.[31][32] After the Akatsuki terrorist leader, Pain, attacks Konohagakure and overwhelms Naruto in combat, Hinata attempts to save the latter while finally admitting her feelings for him.[33] Though, impaled by Pain as means to force Naruto to see the world from his perspective, Hinata survives and her injuries are healed soon afterward by Sakura Haruno.[33][34] When the Fourth Great Ninja War begins, Hinata is placed in the same division as Neji, and she joins Naruto in the battle against the Ten-Tails after her cousin sacrifices himself to protect them.[35] She manages to defeat the clone of the Ten-Tails but later gets caught in the Infinite Tsukuyomi, imagining a relationship with Naruto before being released.[36][37] After Naruto is able to defeat and reform Sasuke, Hinata and everyone else are released from the Infinite Tsukuyomi. She later attends Neji's funeral alongside Naruto and the rest of the Konohagakure shinobi.[38] In the following years, Hinata and Naruto marry and have two children, a son named Boruto Uzumaki and a daughter named Himawari Uzumaki.[39]

In The Last: Naruto the Movie

The three most common appearances of Hinata Hyuga as promoted for The Last: Naruto the Movie. While Masashi Kishimoto drew all them, he left Testuya Nishio in charge of adapting the young adult one (left) due to his inexperience with drawing women.
The events of The Last: Naruto the Movie take place two years after the Fourth Great Ninja War in the series' Part II. At the age of 19, Hinata hopes to give Naruto a red scarf she knitted herself as a gift of love. Soon after this, Toneri Otsutsuki infiltrates Konohagakure and kidnaps Hinata's sister, Hanabi, in order to use her Byakugan (白眼, lit. "White Eye", English manga: "Evil Eye"/"All-Seeing Eye") as his new eyes. Hinata joins Team Kakashi and Shikamaru Nara on the mission to save her sister. During their journey through the abandoned Shinobi village of the Otsutsuki Clan, Naruto returns Hinata's feelings for him. Despite this, Hinata has been contacted by the spirit of her ancestor, Hamura Otsutsuki, to aid him as the "Byakugan Princess"; thus, she allows herself to be captured by Toneri under his belief that they will be getting married. In truth, it is so that she can destroy the Tenseigan (転生眼, lit. "Reincarnation Eye"). However, Toneri discovers the deception and mind-controls Hinata after destroying the scarf she originally created for Naruto. Naruto's team finally catches up, and a massive attack on Toneri's palace begins. The team splits, with Naruto disrupting the wedding ceremony just as Toneri was about to kiss Hinata, while the others secure Hanabi. Hinata carries out Hamura's will by helping Naruto destroy the Tenseigan and stop Toneri. In spite of this, Toneri's Tenseigan chakra cloak grants him the power to slice the moon in half, placing Hinata in a giant bird cage. Naruto enters Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, and a huge duel ensues. Near the end, Naruto grasps the last remaining shred of Hinata's scarf and channels his chakra to deliver a punch strong enough to pin Toneri against the wall and depower him, stopping the moon from falling. Hinata takes Hanabi's eyes back from Toneri and returns them to her sister. Soon after, Hinata and Naruto reaffirm their mutual love as they enter into a relationship that leads to their marriage and the start of their family
