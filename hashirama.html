      Hashirama Senju
Hashirama Senju (千手 柱間, Senju Hashirama), the First Hokage (初代火影, Shodai Hokage) was the co-founder of the first ninja village, Konohagakure, and the former leader of Senju Clan. He is a respected ninja of his era and is known as the "God of Shinobi" (忍の神, Shinobi no Kami). The only naturally born user of Wood Style techniques, Hashirama is also an incarnation of Asura Ōtsutsuki.[ch. 120, 671] Despite experiencing the Warring States period firsthand, Hashirama has a cheerful and happy-go-lucky personality with a desire to end the conflict. As a child, Hashirama forged a friendship with Madara Uchiha before the youth declared them enemies, and they battle on occasion with Hashirama eventually convincing Madara to have their clans make peace while finding Konoha.[ch. 399] He later dies through many wars of his era, though is brought back by the Reanimation Jutsu twice by Orochimaru[ch. 118]; the first of which to battle his former student Hiruzen,[ch. 120] while the second to help Sasuke understand Konoha's history before battling the reanimated Madara in the new war. He manages to make amends with his former friend as the latter lays dying following Kaguya's defeat, and Hashirama is put to rest after helping to transport Team 7 from Kaguya's dimension back to Earth. In the Japanese anime, he is voiced by Takayuki Sugō while Yuki Tai voices him as a child. In the English version, Hashirama is voiced by Jamieson Price in Part I, Peter Lurie in Part II, and JB Blanc in some video games, with Max Mittelman voicing him as a child.
