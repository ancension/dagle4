   Neji Hyūga (日向 ネジ Hyūga Neji) is a fictional character in the Naruto manga and anime series, written and illustrated by manga artist Masashi Kishimoto.
Neji is the only member of the Hyuga Clan with the first name that does not begin with a kanji from the Ha-gyo series (ha, hi, fu, he, ho). Its name means "screw", "spiral" or "helix", and probably refers to its Supreme Rotation technique. The seal on Neji's forehead in the manga is a real swastika, while in the anime it consists of a cross. As part of the Hyūga clan, Neji possesses the innate ability of Byakugan.

Neji Hyuga is a ninja from the Leaf Village, and is part of the Gai team, led by Gai, along with Rock Lee and Tenten. He is a member of the Cadet House of the Hyuga Clan and the son of Hizashi Hyuga. Physically he has a slender appearance, is 181cm tall and with a weight of 73kg.

In the charts of the Japanese magazine Shōnen Jump, Neji has often been present within the Top 10, usually finishing sixth, seventh or eighth.

Some time after the birth of the Leaf Village, the Hyuga clan, to which Neji belongs, split into two houses: the main House, to which only the firstborn Hyuga belong, and the Cadet House, created with the aim of keeping the Hyuga blood lineage pure and preserving the secrets of the Byakugan from the other villages. [6][7] It happened, in fact, that, to prevent the outbreak of a war between the Village of the Leaf and that of the Cloud due to a diplomatic incident, the Cloud asked for the body of Hiashi Hyuga to accept the armistice between the contenders. Hizashi, Hiashi's twin, chose to sacrifice himself instead of his brother. [7] At his death, in fact, his innate ability disappeared with him as a member of the Cadet House. Konoha sent his body to the Cloud, the same as Hiashi's, keeping the agreement. [7]

The truth was long kept hidden from Neji, son of Hizashi, in whom a deep hatred of the main House grew because of his father's sacrifice.[7]

Neji, together with the Gai Team of which he is part, participates in the chunin selection exam during which he initially tries not to be noticed under the advice of the master Gai Maito. [8]
She will pass the first and second exams, respectively the written exam of Ibiki Morino, the test of survival in the Forest of Death and defeating in battle Hinata Hyuga, her cousin, trying to kill her as a member of the main House and, therefore, the target of her hatred. [9][10] In the third and final round he will face Naruto Uzumaki, as per the draw, unleashing techniques perfected by him, which the Cadet House should not know because you teach only the main House, and causing the dismay of Hiashi Hyuga. [11] However, he is defeated by the clash with Naruto, thanks to which he learns that the fate of a human being is not marked by birth. (12]

After the meeting, he learns the truth about his father's sacrifice from Hiashi, his uncle, who was waiting for the right moment to explain the fateful events of the past. From that moment, Neji stops holding a grudge against the main House and agrees to be trained by his uncle. (13]

He reappears in history following the escape of Sasuke Uchiha, is included in a team of only genin, led by the neochunin Shikamaru Nara, organized precisely to bring back to the Village of the Leaf the escaped companion. (14]

He will face Kidomaru, of the Sound Quartet, as per Shikamaru's plan, managing to defeat him. [15] In combat he is pierced by two arrows: one to the shoulder and one to the spleen that will leave him two large holes. [16] His wounds were then treated in the intensive care room by four medical ninjas, to whom Shizune is headed, using as a "base" a lock of his hair in a long operation. [17]

During Naruto's two years of training, Neji becomes jonin. [18] Team Gai, of which he is a member, is sent to the aid of Team 7 and the Sand Village, to retrieve Gaara, Quinto Kazekage, kidnapped by the Alba Organization. [19] While they are on their way to reach them, Alba creates a copy of Kisame Hoshigaki, using 30% of her chakra, which will be remotely commanded by Kisame himself, defeated by Gai through his technique. [20] To deactivate a barrier placed by Pain at the entrance to Alba's lair, he looms, like each of his teammates, in a trap in which a copy of him emerges that has the same skills and techniques. [21] Defeated the copy trap, they arrive in reinforcement to Kakashi Hatake and Naruto who meanwhile face Deidara, a member of the Organization, to recover gaara's body. Gaara is rescued and the mission completed. (22)

Later, after going out on a mission with Team Gai, he hurries back to Konoha as he notices a flock of birds flying in the opposite direction and Gamabunta, lying down and fainting not far from the village, who informs them that his total destruction is underway at the hands of Pain. [23] Arriving at the village, she finds Hinata injured and searches for a medical ninja nearby to treat her. (24]

During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Neji is recruited into the Second Division, led by Kitsuchi and faces several white Zetsu along with Hinata. (25]

After the first day of battle, during the night he guards the camp using his Byakugan, along with Kiba and Akamaru, to warn his comrades in case of enemy attacks. Meanwhile, a white Zetsu takes on his appearance through a particular transformation technique and infiltrates the medical unit: however, he is discovered by Sakura Haruno, who will defeat him and analyze him. The real Neji, meanwhile, falls to the ground from fatigue during the guard shift; his place is taken by Hinata, along with Shino. [26][27].

After recovering and defeating the White Zetsu along with his group, he runs to help Naruto who is facing the Decacoda. In the fight he sacrifices himself to save Hinata and Naruto from an attack of the cercoterio, dying with a smile on his lips and in the arms of his friend after telling him that he chose to die to protect those dear to him, like his father before him.
