    Kakashi Hatake (Japanese: はたけ カカシ, Hepburn: Hatake Kakashi) is a fictional character in the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto. In the story, Kakashi is the teacher of Team 7, consisting of the series' primary characters, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haruno. He is initially portrayed as a detached and apathetic figure, but as the series progresses, his loyalty to his friends and students becomes increasingly apparent. Kakashi's past has been extensively explored in the series, resulting in a gaiden being devoted to his past experiences. Kakashi has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, the featured films in the series, the original video animations, and the video games.

Kakashi was originally created by Kishimoto to be a harsh teacher but the author decided to avoid that. Instead, he made him more generous to calm his students in difficult situations to the point of giving him feminine traits. Kakashi's design gave Kishimoto difficulties as a result of having most of his face covered and as a result it was difficult to show his emotions. For the anime series, he is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese and Dave Wittenberg in the English dub.

Numerous anime and manga publications have praised and criticized Kakashi's character. Although he has been noted to be an echo of similar detached shōnen manga characters, the duality of Kakashi's apathetic and serious sides have been praised. Kakashi has been highly popular with the Naruto reader base, placing high in several popularity polls. Merchandise based on Kakashi has also been released, including key chains and plush dolls.

Kakashi using Lightning Blade.
Kakashi Hatake is introduced as the Jonin (elite ninja) leader in charge of Team 7, a new ninja team including Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. He first appears as a carefree character and tends to lose track of time, being frequently late to his appointments as a result.[19] However, when testing his students, Kakashi reveals himself as a strong opponent to the point of fighting while reading Make Out (イチャイチャ, Icha Icha) series of erotic novels.[20] Kakashi is renowned throughout the Naruto world for the use of his Sharingan, which he received from his teammate Obito Uchiha, and is revered as the ninja who has copied over a thousand jutsus, earning him the moniker "Copy Ninja Kakashi" (コピー忍者のカカシ, Kopī Ninja no Kakashi) and "Kakashi of the Sharingan" (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi). The Sharingan grants him the ability to mimic the movements and jutsu of others.[21][22] Although most of Kakashi's abilities were acquired with his Sharingan, he also invented the Chidori (千鳥, lit. "One Thousand Birds") and its Lightning Blade variation, a collection of lightning chakra in one's hand that uses the Sharingan's visual ability to lock onto a target.[23] When first forming Team 7, Kakashi does not take them as his students until instilling in them the concept of teamwork even if they have to break the rules he gave them.[24] Kakashi continues to further this philosophy for the duration of Part I upon Sasuke Uchiha but is unable to get through to him before the latter's defection from Konoha.[25] Kakashi also reluctantly participates in various challenges by his childhood friend Might Guy who considers Kakashi his rival.

Kakashi's background is explored in Kakashi Gaiden, a six chapter series that divides the gap between Part I and II of the manga. Kakashi is the son of Sakumo Hatake, one of the most powerful shinobi Konoha ever produced, renowned throughout the ninja world as "White Fang of the Leaf". Kakashi was himself a child prodigy and, during the ninja academy years, was hailed as the best of his generation. Following his father's suicide after a failed mission, Kakashi adopted the philosophy that the success of a mission must always come first, over the welfare of his comrades.[26] Kakashi is assigned by his teacher, Minato Namikaze, to lead a mission that would turn the current war in Konoha's favor.[27] When his teammate, Rin Nohara, is captured by enemy ninja, his other teammate, Obito Uchiha, convinces him to rescue her.[28][29] After finding Rin, an enemy-induced cave-in crushed Obito's right half. As his dying wish, Obito has Rin implant his newly acquired Sharingan into Kakashi's freshly damaged eye socket as a parting gift.[30] His new eye in place, Kakashi flees with Rin as the cave collapses, completing their mission.[31] Shortly after this event, Kakashi has to rescue Rin, who is kidnapped by Kirigakure, again; however, he learns that the Kiri, under the influence of Madara Uchiha, have made Rin the host of the Three Tails, Isobu. Rin requests Kakashi kill her so she may not be used as part of a Trojan Horse scheme against Konoha, but Kakashi is reluctant. She eventually forces herself on the way of Kakashi's Lightning Blade that he originally directed at the pursuing Hidden Mist ninja, killing her. An anime exclusive flashback arc in Naruto Shippuden covered Kakashi coping with what he endured during the war as he becomes an ANBU operative during Minato's time as Hokage and influences Yamato into becoming a member of the ANBU as well. Once relieved of duty in the ANBU, Kakashi becomes a Genin instructor prior to the events of Part I.


Kakashi's Mangekyo Sharingan
Two-and-a-half years later in Part II, Kakashi reforms Team 7.[32] During the gap in time, Kakashi hones the Mangekyo Sharingan (万華鏡写輪眼, Mangekyō Sharingan, lit. "Kaleidoscope Copy Wheel Eye") gained from Rin's death to master the Kamui ability that allows him to send any targeted object to another dimension.[33] Because his students are now capable of taking care of themselves, Kakashi takes a more active role in battles, particularly those with the criminal organization Akatsuki.[34] When the Akatsuki leader, Pain, invades Konoha, Kakashi engages him in battle, and dies from exhausting all his energy.[35] However, after his confrontation with Naruto, Pain decides to use all of his remaining power to revive all those killed in the battle at Konoha, including Kakashi.[36] Following a brief encounter with Tobi, the Akatsuki's true leader, Kakashi becomes one of the generals to participate in the war against Tobi's army.[37] As Naruto and Killer Bee continue to battle against Tobi and his forces, Kakashi and Guy arrive to join the fight. During the encounter, Kakashi learns that Tobi is Obito, who in fact had survived his apparent death and had committed to destroying the world order that allowed their friend's demise; Kakashi is left greatly stunned and horrified at Obito's actions.[38] Despite the guilt for what Obito has become, Kakashi is encouraged by Naruto to continue fighting and the battle ends with Kakashi impaling Obito.[39] When Naruto is nearly killed by Madara, Kakashi and a redeemed Obito join forces to protect Naruto by spiriting him off into the latter's dimension to be healed. After Kakashi loses his Sharingan, Naruto uses his new-found abilities to restore his original eye. Kakashi finds himself temporarily infused by the chakra-based spirit of Obito as he gains his friend's full Sharingan abilities and a Susanoo to help his team defeat Kaguya. Kakashi Hatake is the commander of the third battle unit in fourth great ninja war. Following the conclusion of the war, Kakashi is named by Tsunade as her successor, the Sixth Hokage, with his first act being to pardon Sasuke for his crimes.[40] He holds this title for many years before finally passing it to Naruto, as revealed in the epilogue
