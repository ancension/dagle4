    Rock Lee (Japanese: ロック・リー, Hepburn: Rokku Rī) is a fictional character in the anime and manga series Naruto created by Masashi Kishimoto. At first Masashi designed Lee to symbolize human weakness.[3][4] In the anime and manga, Lee is a ninja affiliated with the village of Konohagakure, and is a member of Team Guy, which consists of himself, Neji Hyuga, Tenten, and Might Guy—the team's leader. Unable to use most ninja techniques, Lee dedicates himself to using solely taijutsu, ninja techniques similar to martial arts. Lee dreams of becoming a "splendid ninja" despite his inabilities. Lee has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, including the third and fourth featured films in the series, the third original video animation, and multiple video games.

Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Lee's character. IGN compared Lee to Bruce Lee and Noel Gallagher,[5] and Anime News Network called Lee the "goofiest looking character" in the series.[6] Among the Naruto reader base, Lee has been popular, placing high in several popularity polls.[7][8] Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released in Lee's likeness, including figurines and plush dolls.[9][10]

In Naruto

When he opens the chakra gates, Lee's skin turns red and the power and speed of his taijutsu techniques are enhanced.
Rock Lee is a ninja from Konohagakure part of Team Guy, a four-man cell of ninja led by Might Guy. Inspired by Lee's determination to become stronger despite his inability to perform basic ninja techniques, Guy takes a personal interest in him, deciding to help him achieve his dream of becoming a powerful ninja by using only taijutsu that is primary hand-to-hand combat.[18] This relationship with Guy causes Lee to acquire many of Guy's traits.[19] Lee believes he can surpass the natural talents of others through hard work and passion; throughout the series, he attempts to surpass Neji Hyuga, who is labeled a "genius".[18][20][15] Lee first appears in the series as a participant in the Chunin Exams, twice a year exams for ninja who wish to increase their rank. During the Chunin Exams, Lee battles Gaara, a ninja from the village of Sunagakure. In the fight, Lee opens the five of the eight chakra gates, limits on the body's ability to use chakra, using a forbidden technique known as the Hidden Lotus, increasing his natural abilities at the cost of his health.[21] Despite his effort, Gaara cripples Lee by crushing his left arm and leg, injuring Lee to the point that he must abandon being a ninja.[22]

When Tsunade, a Konohagakure medical ninja, returns to lead the village as the Fifth Hokage, she offers to operate on him.[23] Despite the procedure's fifty percent chance of failure, Guy encourages Lee to have the operation. Ultimately, Lee undergoes the surgery, which succeeds in healing his arm and leg.[24] Immediately after the operation, Lee follows a team of ninja led by Shikamaru Nara who attempt to stop Sasuke Uchiha from defecting from Konohagakure to the village of Otogakure.[25] Lee battles the Otogakure ninja Kimimaro through using the Potion Punch (酔拳, Suiken, literally "Drunken Fist", English TV: "Loopy Fist") fighting style in which he becomes inebriated with unpredictable attacks.[26][27] When Kimimaro is on the verge of defeating Lee, Gaara intervenes, continuing the battle.[20]

In Part II, Lee obtains the rank of Chunin, and is dispatched with his team to help save Gaara following his abduction by the criminal organization Akatsuki.[28] During the events of the Fourth Shinobi War Lee is assigned to the Third Division, Lee helps in fighting the Kabuto Yakushi's reanimated army and later aids Naruto Uzumaki in the fight against Obito Uchiha and Madara Uchiha.[29] Years after the war, Lee marries an unknown woman and has a son named Metal Lee. In the epilogue, Lee is last seen many years later, training with his son. In Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Lee hosts the third stage of the Chunin Exam.
